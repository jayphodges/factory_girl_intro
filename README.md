## FactoryGirl Sandbox

This branch requires a Ruby version in the 2.3.x range. If you need one, run
`rvm install ruby-2.3.1`.

To get started, clone down and:

```
git checkout factory-girl
bundle install
rake db:{create,migrate}
rspec
```

Refactor the model tests using FactoryGirl. The gem and folder setup is good to
go, just add the factory files.
